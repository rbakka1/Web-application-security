# Web Application and Network Security Projects

This repository contains two projects focused on securing web applications and network communications. These projects explore SSL/TLS for secure connections and HTTP cookies for session management.

### **1. Secure Session Establishment with SSL/TLS**
- Analyze the SSL/TLS handshake (`ClientHello`, `ServerHello`, certificate exchange, key exchange).
- Ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in data transmission.
- Tools: Wireshark for traffic capture and analysis.

### **2. Session Persistence with Cookies in HTTP**
- Understand how `Set-Cookie` and `Cookie` headers manage session states.
- Analyze HTTP traffic to observe cookie exchanges.
- Tools: Wireshark for analyzing session persistence.

## **Deliverables**
- Reports explaining each project's findings.
- Wireshark packet captures with annotations.
