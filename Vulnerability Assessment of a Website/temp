# Vulnerability Assessment of a Website

This project documents the vulnerability assessment performed on **[Insert Domain Name]** using several tools on Kali Linux. The assessment aimed to identify potential security weaknesses and misconfigurations using multiple scanning tools.

## Tools & Environment

- **Operating System:** Kali Linux
- **Assessment Tools:**
  - **OpenVAS:** Installed and configured to perform a comprehensive vulnerability scan.
  - **Nikto:** Used to scan the web server for known vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
  - **Nmap:** Employed for network scanning to identify open ports, active services, and potential security issues.
  - **Legion:** Utilized for further vulnerability analysis and exploitation checks.

## Assessment Process

1. **Installation & Setup**
   - Installed and configured OpenVAS on Kali Linux.
   - Verified that Nikto, Nmap, and Legion were installed and up to date.

2. **Vulnerability Assessment Using OpenVAS**
   - Ran a full scan on the target domain to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
   - Analyzed the generated reports to document potential risks.

3. **Vulnerability Assessment Using Nikto**
   - Executed Nikto to scan the web server for outdated software, common vulnerabilities, and configuration issues.
   - Recorded the findings for further analysis.

4. **Vulnerability Assessment Using Nmap**
   - Performed network scanning to detect open ports, running services, and network-level vulnerabilities.
   - Cross-referenced the results with other tool outputs for comprehensive coverage.

5. **Vulnerability Assessment Using Legion**
   - Conducted additional tests with Legion to identify vulnerabilities that might have been missed by the other tools.
   - Compared results to ensure consistency and thoroughness in the assessment.
